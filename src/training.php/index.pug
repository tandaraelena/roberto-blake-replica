        p Having someone be able to help you set an agenda and outline for developing your brand, improving your marketing or setting up your digital presence, can greatly accelerate your success and reduce frustration. The difference between success and failure is rarely a lack of ability or even effort, but a lack of clear objectives and the practical means to reach them. Being held accountable, and having additional guidance, techncial expertise or even just and outside perspective, can make a measurable difference.
